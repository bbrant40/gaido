<h2>What is Gaido?</h2>
<p>Gaido is like having a local show you around their city! A new app for travellers who want to become fully immersed in the cities they visit and learn more about each destination than what you'll find on GoogleMaps.</p>
<p>We offer self-guided tours, themed around art, food, culture and more. Explore completely at your own pace, skipping what doesn't interest you and finding out more about what does.</p>
<p>Gaido currently offers tours in <b>London, Paris, Tokyo and over 25 other cities</b>, with more being added every week.</p>
